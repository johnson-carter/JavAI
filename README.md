**JavAI**
Java provides lots of flexibility for programmers working across multiple desktop environments. In order to further the state of machine learning algorithms based in Java, I created this project to showcase some simple mathematical learning models.
Currently, this project features a multivariate linear regression model. The model and it's training data comes packaged with a simple swing dashboard allowing for quick prediction, updates to training, and viewing model weights.

*Installation*
There is no jar package for this project currently. To run these models, ensure you have the latest version of Java's SDK. Launch via:
1. Command line
    - Navigate to the MultiFeatureRegressionModel folder
    - Run javac MultiFeatureRegressionModel.java  (use RegressionDashboard.java for an enhanced GUI experience)
    - Run java MultiFeatureRegressionModel.java
2. IDE
    - Open the project folder in your IDE/text editor
    - Compile and run the file using play buttons
