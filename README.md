**JavAI**
Java provides lots of flexibility for programmers working across multiple desktop environments. In order to further the state of machine learning algorithms based in Java, I created this project to showcase some simple mathematical learning models.
Currently, this project features simple linear regression, logistic regression, and multivariate linear regression models. The models and their training data comes packaged with a simple swing dashboard allowing for quick prediction, updates to training, and viewing model weights.

*Installation*
There is no jar package for this project currently. To run these models, ensure you have the latest version of Java's SDK. Launch via:
1. Command line
    - Navigate to the MultiFeatureRegressionModel folder
    - Run javac MultiFeatureRegressionModel.java  (use RegressionDashboard.java for an enhanced GUI experience)
    - Run java MultiFeatureRegressionModel.java
2. IDE
    - Open the project folder in your IDE/text editor
    - Compile and run the file using play buttons
